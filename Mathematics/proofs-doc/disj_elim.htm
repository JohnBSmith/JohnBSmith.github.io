<p>Disjunction elimination. This formalizes the proof
by cases. If C follows in case of A as well as in case of B, then it
follows from the disjunction A&nbsp;∨&nbsp;B too. Namely, if this disjunction,
read "A&nbsp;or&nbsp;B", is true, then at least one of the propositions A,&nbsp;B
should be true. But if the truth of C follows, regardless of which of
them it is, then C stays constantly true under the truth of the
disjunction. Therefore this rule must be valid.</p>
