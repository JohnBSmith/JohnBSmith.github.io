<p>The <i>singleton</i> set {a} is explained as the set that
contains only a. Thus it could have been defined simply as
{x | x = a}, but for ergonomic reasons we force the condition x = a
only if a is a set. Namely, given that we are only aware of a to be
a set under the classes a and b, we can nevertheless deduce a = b from
{a} = {b}.</p>
