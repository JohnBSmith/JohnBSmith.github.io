<h3>Axiom eq_refl</h3>

<p>States, that equality is a reflexive relation. Note that
equality is defined on the entire class universe. This differs from the
diagonal relation E = {t | ∃x. t = (x,&nbsp;x)}. Firstly, E is only
defined on the universal class, i.e. only for sets, but
not for proper classes. Secondly, one has to write (x,&nbsp;x) ∈ E instead of
E&nbsp;x&nbsp;x, since E is a class, not a binary relation symbol. The syntax
x = x, on the other hand, is a shorthand for eq&nbsp;x&nbsp;x.</p>
