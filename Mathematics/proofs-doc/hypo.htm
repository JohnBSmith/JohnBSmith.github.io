<h3>Rule hypo</h3>
<div class='box'><div class='rule'><b class='rule'>Rule.</b> hypo<br>
(⊤ ∧ A ⊢ A)</div></div>
<p>The hypothesis rule, also known as the assumption rule.
It states that the initial sequent A&nbsp;⊢&nbsp;A may be introduced, i.e.
derived from zero premises. The seemingly useless conjunction with
the verum&nbsp;⊤ is an artifact of the way the proof verifier works; it
does not occur in proof notation and can be ignored. The derivation
system stated by the rules is sequent natural deduction. In this regard,
the assumption made by the hypothesis rule appears as a dependency that
can later be uncharged by <a href='subj_intro.htm'>subj_intro</a> or <a href='neg_intro.htm'>neg_intro</a>.</p>
